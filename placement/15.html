        <h2>April 2017</h2>

        <p>With prospective students now receiving their offers to join Ulster University, I received an email asking me to update the information on the enrolment webpages (known as welcome packs) for the Built Environment courses (e.g. http://adbe.ulster.ac.uk/enrolment/courses/ceg.php ). When I saw this link in the email I immediately noticed that it was hosted on an old University sub-domain which the Digital Team and I had been working on getting rid of. </p>

        <p>I sent off an email to the team asking for permission to migrate this to the new website, giving them my reasons for why I thought the move should be made. Mark Kennedy agreed with my viewpoint and was happy that I had made the suggestion. It made the job a little more complicated in terms of having much more work to do within the same timeframe, but the extra effort would be worth it in the long run, and gave me the opportunity to work on a project from the beginning. </p>

        <p>My first port of call was to create 22 new webpages within the ADBE faculty site. As these pages were only to be viewed by students who received a link in an email, I chose to remove them from the sidebar menus throughout the website. Within the CMS, I set up multiple containers for each section in a page and gave them relevant titles, which would keep it easy to update and consistent when the future placement students go to edit the information. </p>

        <p>Once this was done it was just a case of inputting the content which I had been sent within Word documents. The webpages were quite lengthy as they had a lot of content within them and this couldn't be avoided, so I utilised tables and page breaks to split up the content and make it a little more interesting to look at. The CMS standard theme means that headings, for example, in tables have a navy blue background colour to fit within the brand, but on this page I felt it looked out of place, as the menu used the ADBE faculty pink in its heading and to show which page was selected. I was able to change the CMS from WYSIWYG to the Raw HTML setting, and used inline-CSS to change the colour of the header background to the faculty pink, and the header text to white to further differentiate it from the rest of the body text. Keeping within the brand guidelines I changed all email addresses to mailto links to keep it consistent throughout the entire website, and used images at the top of the page.</p>

        <p>At the end I set up a quick list of links to each of the pages so the tutors and editors could access each of them quickly. This project took me around three days in total to complete. Once I had established the layout and style of the page, I was able to copy and paste this onto the rest of the pages and simply edit the content to make it relevant to the individual course. I also set up a page with links to each of the Built Environment courses so the faculty staff could easily find each page instead of having to find each individual URL. Working on a project like this definitely put my knowledge of the brand guidelines to the test, because as someone with a keen interest in user interface design, it would be so easy to get carried away with styling the pages. I'm glad I had the opportunity to work on this project, and after completing it I have put forward the a request to the School of Art and Design to migrate their welcome pack pages to the new website also. </p>
