        <h2>December 2016</h2>

        <p>With the website live, the Digital team handed over management of the PhD Opportunities section to me. I was to treat this section as if it were a faculty on its own, meaning I would have to manage the content, ensuring that it is updated as and when needed. Although this will be a relatively simple task because the Research Institutes both tend to take care of their own opportunities, it will give me good experience in managing and updating content on a live website. </p>

        <p>After a few days I received an email with the PhD Opportunities information to put onto both the Built Environment Research Institute (BERI) website and the Research Institute of Art and Design (RIAD) website. Instead of using the WYSIWYG editor I chose to work directly with code to add the information to the BERI website because I found that easier. This was quite time consuming to do as there was a lot of information to add and it was crucial that I paid close attention to detail and made sure that everything was correct before setting it live.</p>

        <p>The next job was to add the information to the RIAD website, however I ran into a problem when I realised that the RIAD website hadn't been set to go live yet on the new University website. I set out to contact Mark to see what the timeline for RIAD to go live was, however it wouldn't be going live for the foreseeable future which meant that the information needed to be added to the old website <span class="strikethrough">(http://riad.ulster.ac.uk)</span>. This was another issue because I didn't have access to edit this website as it wasn't created using a CMS like the new website has been. </p>
            
        <p>**Update: Since writing this post the old website has been taken down and instead is a redirect to the updated University website.</p>

        <p>I then discovered that the website used WebDAV. So I spent some time getting familiar with the files already there and seeing how they were laid out so I could maintain some form of consistency. I created a PHP file and inserted the template, then I used a simple list layout with a sliding/hiding div to display the PhD topics in clusters. When the user clicked on a research cluster, the div would slide out with the themes available to them and a link to the PDF file with all the information. I decided to do this because the design of the page looks cluttered and busy enough; adding reams of text would just complicate it further. Luckily I had picked up on these techniques during a PHP module in year two, so I wasn't going into this project blind!</p>

        <p>With all of these changes and constantly pushing through updates I made sure to pay particular attention to the workflow comment section when sending the page off for approval by entering what changes I had made. This was something I did when using GitHub without realising its importance, but this week I was told that it was making the DC Team's job a lot easier because they didn't have to go looking for the specific changes among reams of text.</p>
