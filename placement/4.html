        <h2>October 2016</h2>
            
        <p>After many meetings and a short but sweet training session, I was finally allowed to begin working on the new faculty website. Ulster University's website is in the process of migrating from many smaller, separate websites into one under their main domain. To do this, a CMS called Squiz is used to manage the content.</p>

        <p>My first role was with the 'About' page for the Faculty of ADBE. I needed to read through the content and figure out a way to break it up more because there was quite a bit of text sitting plainly, but it needed to be consistent with the rest of the website. Looking through the website I could see that most pages only have one image, so breaking up the text with images was out of the question. I decided to break up the text into shorter paragraphs to make it look less daunting, and then I added in headings above every few paragraphs. This made it easier for the user to skip to the information that they were looking for, but it also meant that they wouldn't be staring at this big chunk of text on the page also. I then signed off this page and it was approved. </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/faculties/art-design-and-built-environment/about">You can visit that page by clicking here</a>.</p>

        <p>Task number two; events. This was the longest task and in reflection it was a little tedious, because I had to go through pages of news and events on the Belfast School of Art and Architecture websites that spanned back to 2013 and migrate them onto the new website individually. This meant creating each new event separately, searching for new images in the image bank that was appropriate for the event, then copying over the event titles and descriptions. I also found myself having to fix a few spelling and grammar errors in the posts. Finally then I had to go through the metadata for each event, writing a quick summary for each and selecting the campus, location, times, event type and then tagging the Faculty and School. Attention to detail was really important for this task and although it took ages to do, it was rewarding to see the events approved and live on the website.</p>

        <p>Task number three was concerning the Research Graduate School and migrating over the PhD Opportunities information and styling it to match fit in with the new style. What I like about working with the Squiz CMS is that I can work with HTML and CSS within the editor, which I find to be faster than searching through the menu bar for the button to add a list or hyperlink. I broke up the information on the page, again, using headings and also used unordered lists to break up the links which were just inline within a paragraph, so it is easier to scroll to the link instead of having to read through. All of the links also needed to be changed to link to the new website.</p>

        <p>For my next two tasks I had to work with other members of staff to gather their input before I could finalise the main faculty pages for both the School of Art and the School of Architecture. This involved going over the introduction copy which is what the user will see first underneath images, checking for spelling and grammar errors. Similarly with the 'About' pages for each and checking over all images that were used to make sure that they were appropriate. The Belfast School of Architecture images needed changing because it was felt that they didn't suit the sections perfectly, so a meeting was scheduled and this was resolved.</p>
